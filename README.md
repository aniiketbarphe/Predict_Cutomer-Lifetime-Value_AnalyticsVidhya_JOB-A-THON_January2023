Predict CLTV of a customer

Can you help the company identify the most potential customers?

Problem Statement


VahanBima is one of the leading insurance companies in India. It provides motor vehicle insurances at best prices with 24/7 claim settlement.  It offers different types of policies for  both personal and commercial vehicles. It has established its brand across different regions in India. 

Around 90% of the businesses today use personalized services. The company wants to launch different personalized experience programs for customers of VahanBima. The personalized experience can be dedicated resources for claim settlement, different kinds of services at doorstep, etc. Inorder to do so, they would like to segment the customers into different tiers based on their customer lifetime value (CLTV).

Inorder to do it, they would like to predict the customer lifetime value based on the activity and interaction of the customer with the platform. So, as a part of this challenge, your task at hand is to build a high performance and interpretable machine learning model to predict the CLTV based on the user and policy data.

Evaluation metric

The evaluation metric for this hackathon would be r2_score.


Public and Private Split

Test data is further divided into Public (40%) and Private (60%) data. 

Your initial responses will be checked and scored on the Public data. The final rankings would be based on your private score which will be published once the competition is over.
